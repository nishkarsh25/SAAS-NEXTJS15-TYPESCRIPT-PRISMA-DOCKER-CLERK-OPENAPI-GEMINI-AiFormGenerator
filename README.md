## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/SAAS-NEXTJS15-TYPESCRIPT-PRISMA-DOCKER-CLERK-OPENAPI-GEMINI-AiFormGenerator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## How to Use

This AI-powered form generator makes it incredibly easy to generate and manage dynamic forms with the help of LLMs (OpenAI/Gemini). Here's how to get started:

### 1. Sign In / Sign Up
- Visit the app and sign in using Clerk authentication.
- If you're a new user, you'll be prompted to sign up using your email or social accounts.


### 2. Generate a Form Using AI
- Click on **"Create New Form"** in the **My Forms** section.
- Enter a clear and concise prompt describing the form you want (e.g., "A job application form with name, email, resume upload").
- Submit the prompt — the AI will generate a form based on your input using OpenAI or Gemini.


### 3. View and Manage Forms
- All your generated forms will appear under **My Forms**.
- Click on any form card to:
  - Preview or test the form.
  - Edit the generated fields.
  - Share the form with others.


### 4. View Form Submissions
- Each form tracks submissions in real-time.
- Go to a specific form's detail page to see user responses, organized as **Question-Answer** pairs.


### 5. Track Analytics
- Visit the **Analytics** section to monitor:
  - Total number of forms generated.
  - Number of submissions per form.
  - A visual summary of your engagement.


### 6. Upgrade Plan (If Needed)
- Free-tier users can create up to 3 forms.
- To create more, navigate to the **Upgrade** page and subscribe to a paid plan via **Stripe**.
- After successful payment, your form generation limit is lifted.


### 7. Success Confirmation
- After upgrading, you’ll be redirected to a **Success** page.
- From there, you can start creating unlimited forms instantly.


Enjoy building AI-generated forms effortlessly! 💡
