# NEXTJS15-REACT19-TYPESCRIPT-ROUTING-CACHING-ZOD-PRISMA-NEXTAUTHv5-DiscussApp

Welcome to the NEXTJS project! This comprehensive guide will walk you through every aspect of this project, including its structure, setup instructions, usage, API endpoints, backend, frontend, contributing guidelines, license information, and how to get in touch for support or inquiries.

## Introduction

**Discuss App** is a modern full-stack web application built as a learning project to explore and implement advanced features of the latest web development technologies. It is designed as a discussion platform where users can create topics, post under them, and participate in nested comment threads.

This project was primarily aimed at learning and applying:

- **Next.js 15** for routing, server actions, and optimized rendering strategies  
- **React 19** features like enhanced Suspense and modern rendering patterns  
- **TypeScript** for strong typing and scalable code architecture  
- **Routing and Caching** mechanisms in Next.js for improved UX and performance  
- **Zod** for robust form validation and schema enforcement  
- **Prisma** as the ORM for database access, including **recursive/nested queries** for threaded comments  
- **NextAuth v5** for authentication, session handling, and secure access control

The core highlight of this project is the implementation of **nested Prisma queries** to support recursive comment trees, allowing for replies to replies in a scalable and clean way.

## Features

- **Authentication** using NextAuth v5 (Sign in/out, session persistence)
- **Nested Comments** with recursive rendering (reply to any comment)
- **Topic-based Post Organization** — each post belongs to a specific topic
- **Post Creation Dialog** with form validation via Zod
- **Comment Creation Form** with real-time reply toggling and validation
- **Optimized Routing and Data Fetching** using Next.js 15’s server actions and caching strategies
- **Type-safe Backend Integration** via Prisma and TypeScript
- **Robust Form Handling** with clear error reporting and dynamic feedback
- **Modern UI** built with component-based architecture (Dialog, Buttons, Cards)

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/NEXTJS15-REACT19-TYPESCRIPT-ROUTING-CACHING-ZOD-PRISMA-NEXTAUTHv5.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

##  How to Use

Once the Discuss App is up and running, here's how you can interact with it:

### Authentication
- Sign in securely using **NextAuth v5** (custom or OAuth provider depending on setup).
- Only authenticated users can create topics, posts, or comments.

### Topics
- Click **"New Topic"** to create a discussion category.
- Each topic contains multiple posts relevant to that category.

### Posts
- Inside a topic, create a new post with a **title** and **content**.
- Posts are listed chronologically and show the number of comments.

### Comments (Nested)
- Comment on a post using the reply form.
- Supports **infinite nesting** (recursive replies) using **nested Prisma queries**.
- Replies are shown as threaded discussions, maintaining conversation context.

### Search
- Use the search bar to look for posts by keyword or topic.

### Performance
- Fast and responsive UI using **React 19** and **Next.js 15** features like **partial pre-rendering** and **server actions**.
- Leveraging **route caching** and **progressive data loading**.

### Validation
- All forms are validated using **Zod** before submission, ensuring data consistency and user feedback.
